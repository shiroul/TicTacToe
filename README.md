## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that aims to find the best move for the AI while assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. It's a classic example of game theory.

## Demo

You can play a live demo of the game [here](https://shiroul.github.io/TicTacToe/).

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent.
- AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- Interactive user interface for gameplay.
- Clear display of game outcomes (win, lose, draw).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have a modern web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-minimax.git

2. Open HTML file:

   Open the project directory and navigate to the HTML file in your web browser.

### Usage

- Open the HTML file in your web browser using theinstructions provided in the "Installation" section.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the AI opponent.
- Make your move by clicking on the grid where you want to place your symbol (X or O).
- The AI will respond with its move.
- Continue playing until the game is won, lost, or ends in a draw.

### Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe. It tries to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario while maximizing the potential gain. The algorithm explores all possible moves and outcomes to determine the best move for the AI opponent.
